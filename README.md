# Weather-Dashboard-Server-Side-API

## Description

This Project was designed as a homework assignment for OSU's Coding bootcamp hosted by Trilogy. 

The weather dashboard is created using HTML, Bootstrap, Javasctipt, Moment cdn, and OpenWeather api. The Open Weather Api was used to fetch data from the api link to be able to populate current day's weather and the next five days of forecast for the searched city. The searched city is then saved to the local storage for a call back button, thus the user can click on a past searched city to populate the weather data without searching the city again.  

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.
